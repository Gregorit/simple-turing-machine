# Simple Turing Machine
*Turing machine dataset problem solver.*

CAUTION: Output in Polish!

## Prerequisites
This script is executable in **Python 3.8** (or higher) **only**!
Get it here:

```
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/
```


## Usage
```sh
$ python3 turing.py datasets/dataset_basic.txt
```

By default output for each iteration is disabled - to enable it add following argument
```sh
$ python3 turing.py datasets/dataset_basic.txt --output
```

Instead of prints on the screen you can output them to textfile.
```sh
$ python3 turing.py datasets/dataset_basic.txt > output.log
```

## Extra info
This is a project made for university class.
Example of dataset file syntax is in *datasets* catalog.
